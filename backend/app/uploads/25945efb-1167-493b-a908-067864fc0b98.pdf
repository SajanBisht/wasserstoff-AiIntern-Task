The Graphic Era Deemed-to-be-University's Computer Science and Engineering department offered a comprehensive curriculum. Semester I focused on computer fundamentals and introductory C programming, covering computer generations, data types, control structures, and functions.  Semester II built upon this, exploring advanced C programming concepts like pointers, structures, and file handling, and introducing Python. Semester III delved into logic design, computer organization, and data structures, including trees and graphs, alongside object-oriented programming in C++.  A discrete structures course covered sets, functions, probability, and graph theory.  Semester III also included labs for logic design, data structures, and object-oriented programming.  Semester IV continued with algorithm design and analysis, microprocessors (8085, 8086, 8051), and a discrete mathematics course covering relations, groups, probability and graph theory.  Labs covered microprocessors and algorithm implementation. Finally, semester V introduced cloud computing, IoT, cryptography, and data science, including statistical analysis and R programming, with labs focusing on data structures and object-oriented programming in C++.  Semester VI explored system software, operating systems, and database management systems with their respective labs.  In addition, students could pursue electives in mathematical foundations of AI, probability, and a python programming course for computing along with specializations in cloud computing, statistical data science with R and introduction to cryptography and PKC.  Advanced courses in the following semesters focused on specialization areas like virtualization, Big data analytics, network security, AI, and soft computing.
